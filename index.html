            My name is Santiago.<img alt="Hi There!" src="I/myAvatar.png" class='avatar'> 
            I have always had a special place in my heart for anything to do with computers, electricity, engineering, graphic design, and so on. You get it.
            This is a website I made for myself to show some of my projects. 
            The projects are mostly JavaScript which is used to build websites.
            Right now I'm doing this just for fun, but in the future it might be nice for potential job offers. I dunno, I'll see.
            Anyway, thats it. Go look at my projects, they're cool. Bye!
